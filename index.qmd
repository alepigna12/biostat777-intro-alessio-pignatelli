I am international student from Italy, I graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Science (S.B.) in Engineering Sciences with a Secondary in Statistics. I decided to pursue Biostatistics because it lies at the intersection of two big passions of mine: healthcare (I originally intended to go into Biomedical engineering with my undergraduate degree) and statistics.

In my free-time, I love doing and watching sports. Here's a picture of me finishing the Baltimore marathon last month.
